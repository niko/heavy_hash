h1. HeavyHash

HeavyHash is a nested Hash like object which provides a payload array per node. I use it for Websockets, to remember connections to a client (each called a channel). The connections are opened on a URL by a client.

<pre><code>@channels = HeavyHash.new
@channels.path(@connection1.path) << @connection1
@channels.path(@connection2.path) << @connection2
</code></pre>

... and in a sinatra app:

<pre><code>post '*' do
  parsed_message = JSON.parse(params[:message])
  message = parsed_message.to_json
  @channels.path(*params[:splat]).leaves.each do |connection|
    connection.send message
  end
end
</code></pre>

There are two methods to access a node: @[key1][key2]@ and @path('/key1/key2)@. The latter is just a convenience method for the first.

Each node has two getters: @content@ and @leaves@. @content@ return a nodes payload (added by @<<@), @leaves@ returns the sum of a nodes and all its subnodes payload.

There are two methods to change a HeavyHash tree: @<<@ and @remove()@. @<<@ adds a payload to a node and @remove@ (surprise) removes it again. When removing the last payload from a node the node itself gets deleted. Also all empty parent nodes are deleted.

h2. Installation

<pre><code>gem install heavy_hash

h2. Issues

Head right over to the "Issues tab":https://github.com/niko/heavy_hash/issues

I'm glad to help.

h2. Other projects

You might want to look at the "tree gem":https://rubygems.org/gems/tree

It's got more of the usual tree access and traversal methods and the payload is less specific. Access and deep construction is less convenient (IHMO).
